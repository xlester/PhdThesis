  abstract = {The detuning phase shift error is a common systematic error observed
	in temporal phase shifting (TPS) algorithms. This error, generally
	due to miscalibration of the phase shifter, is solved by using a
	quadrature filter insensitive to this detuning error. To compare
	algorithms, this error is frequently analyzed numerically. However,
	in this work we present an exact and analytical expression to calculate
	such error which is applicable to any kind of filters with real or
	complex frequency response. Finally, a table with the detuning error
	for several algorithms is reported.},

  abstract = {A self-scanned 1024 element photodiode array and minicomputer are
	used to measure the phase (wavefront) in the interference pattern
	of an interferometer to $\lambda$/100. The photodiode array samples
	intensities over a 32 {\texttimes} 32 matrix in the interference
	pattern as the length of the reference arm is varied piezoelectrically.
	Using these data the minicomputer synchronously detects the phase
	at each of the 1024 points by a Fourier series method and displays
	the wavefront in contour and perspective plot on a storage oscilloscope
	in less than 1 min (Bruning et al. Paper WE16, OSA Annual Meeting,
	Oct. 1972). The array of intensities is sampled and averaged many
	times in a random fashion so that the effects of air turbulence,
	vibrations, and thermal drifts are minimized. Very significant is
	the fact that wavefront errors in the interferometer are easily determined
	and may be automatically subtracted from current or subsequent wavefrots.
	Various programs supporting the measurement system include software
	for determining the aperture boundary, sum and difference of wavefronts,
	removal or insertion of tilt and focus errors, and routines for spatial
	manipulation of wavefronts. FFT programs transform wavefront data
	into point spread function and modulus and phase of the optical transfer
	function of lenses. Display programs plot these functions in contour
	and perspective. The system has been designed to optimize the collection
	of data to give higher than usual accuracy in measuring the individual
	elements and final performance of assembled diffraction limited optical
	systems, and furthermore, the short loop time of a few minutes makes
	the system an attractive alternative to constraints imposed by test
	glasses in the optical shop.},

  abstract = {We deal with the relation between two well-known topics in signal
	processing and computational vision: quadrature filters (QF's) and
	Bayesian estimation with Markov random fields (MRF's) as prior models.
	We present a new class of complex-valued MRF models such that the
	optimal estimators obtained with them correspond to the output of
	QF's tuned at particular frequencies. It is shown that the machinery
	that has proven to be effective in classical (real-valued) MRF modeling
	may be generalized to the complex case in a straightforward way.
	To illustrate the power of this technique, we present complex MRF
	models that implement robust QF's that exhibit good performance in
	situations in which ordinary linear, shift-invariant filters fail.
	These include robust filters that are relatively insensitive to edge
	effects and missing data and that can reliably estimate the local
	phase in singularity neighborhoods; we also present models for the
	specification of piecewise-smooth QF's. Examples of applications
	to fringe pattern analysis, phase-based stereo reconstruction, and
	texture segmentation are presented as well.},

  abstract = {A principled approach, based on Bayesian estimation theory and complex-valued

	a new class of adaptive quadrature filters. These filters are capable
	of adapting their tuning frequency to the local dominant spatial
	frequency of the input image while maintaining an arbitrarily narrow
	local frequency response; therefore they may be effectively used
	for the accurate recovery of the phase of broadband spatial-carrier
	fringe patterns, even when they are corrupted by a significant amount
	of noise. Also, by constraining the spatial variation of the adaptive
	frequency to be smooth, they permit the completely automatic recovery
	of local phase from single closed fringe pattern images, since the
	spurious discontinuities and sign reversals that one obtains from
	the classical Fourier-based methods are avoided in this case. Although
	the applications discussed here come from fringe pattern analysis
	in optics, these filters may also be useful in the solution of other

  abstract = {This paper shows how measurement errors in phase shifting interferometry
	(PSI) can be described to a high degree of accuracy in a linear approximation.
	System error sources considered here are light source instability,
	imperfect reference phase shifting, mechanical vibrations, nonlinearity
	of the detector, and quantization of the detector signal. The measurement
	inaccuracies resulting from these errors are calculated in linear
	approximation for several formulas commonly used for PSI. The results
	are presented in tables for easy calculation of the measurement error
	magnitudes for known system errors. In addition, this paper discusses
	the measurement error reduction which can be achieved by choosing
	an appropriate phase calculation formula.},

	shifts in generalized phase-shifting interferometry (PSI) is proposed

  abstract = {A novel method is presented to extract phase distribution from phase-shifted
	interferograms with unknown tilt phase shifts. The proposed method
	can estimate the tilt phase shift between two temporal phase-shifted
	interferograms with high accuracy, by extending the regularized optical
	flow method with the spatial image processing and frequency estimation
	technology. With all the estimated tilt phase shifts, the phase component
	encoded in the interferograms can be extracted by the least-squares
	method. Both simulation and experimental results have fully proved
	the feasibility of the proposed method. Particularly, a flat-based
	diffractive optical element with quasi-continuous surface is tested
	by the proposed method with introduction of considerably large tilt
	phase shift amounts (i.e., the highest estimated tilt phase shift
	amount between two consecutive frame reaches 6.18\&\#x03BB;). The
	phase extraction result is in good agreement with that of Zygo\&\#x2019;s
	MetroPro software under steady-state testing conditions, and the
	residual difference between them is discussed. In comparison with
	the previous methods, the proposed method not only has relatively
	little restrictions on the amounts or orientations of the tilt phase
	shifts, but also works well with interferograms including open and
	closed fringes in any combination.},
