  abstract = {We deal with the relation between two well-known topics in signal
	processing and computational vision: quadrature filters (QF's) and
	Bayesian estimation with Markov random fields (MRF's) as prior models.
	We present a new class of complex-valued MRF models such that the
	optimal estimators obtained with them correspond to the output of
	QF's tuned at particular frequencies. It is shown that the machinery
	that has proven to be effective in classical (real-valued) MRF modeling
	may be generalized to the complex case in a straightforward way.
	To illustrate the power of this technique, we present complex MRF
	models that implement robust QF's that exhibit good performance in
	situations in which ordinary linear, shift-invariant filters fail.
	These include robust filters that are relatively insensitive to edge
	effects and missing data and that can reliably estimate the local
	phase in singularity neighborhoods; we also present models for the
	specification of piecewise-smooth QF's. Examples of applications
	to fringe pattern analysis, phase-based stereo reconstruction, and
	texture segmentation are presented as well.},

  journal = {Opt. Express},

  volume = {14},
  pages = {3204--3213},
  number = {8},
  month = {Apr},
  abstract = {We present a phase shifting robust method for irregular and unknown
	phase steps. The method is formulated as the minimization of ahalf-quadratic
	(robust) regularized cost function for simultaneously computing phase
	maps and arbitrary phase shifts. The convergence to, at least, a
	local minimum is guaranteed. The algorithm can be understood as a
	phase refinement strategy that uses as initial guess a coarsely computed
	phase and coarsely estimated phase shifts. Such a coarse phase is
	assumed to be corrupted with artifacts produced by the use of a phase
	shifting algorithm but with imprecise phase steps. The refinement
	is achieved by iterating alternated minimization of the cost function
	for computing the phase map correction, an outliers rejection map
	and the phase shifts correction, respectively. The method performance
	is demonstrated by comparison with standard filtering and arbitrary
	phase steps detecting algorithms.},

  abstract = {Most standard temporal-phase-shifting (TPS) algorithms evaluate the
	phase by computing a windowed Fourier transform (WFT) of the intensity
	signal at the carrier frequency of the system. However, displacement
	of the specimen during image acquisition may cause the peak of the
	transform to shift away from the carrier frequency, leading to phase
	errors and even unwrapping failure. We present a novel TPS method
	that searches for the peak of the WFT and evaluates the phase at
	that frequency instead of at the carrier frequency. The performance
	of this method is compared with that of standard algorithms by using
	numerical simulations. Experimental results from high-speed speckle
	interferometry studies of carbon fiber panels are also presented.},

  abstract = {We have been reporting several new techniques of analysis and synthesis
	applied to Phase Shifting Interferometry (PSI). These works are based
	upon the Frequency Transfer Function (FTF) and how this new tool
	of analysis and synthesis in PSI may be applied to obtain very general
	results, among them; rotational invariant spectrum; complex PSI algorithms
	synthesis based on simpler first and second order quadrature filters;
	more accurate formulae for estimating the detuning error; output-power
	phase noise estimation. We have made our cases exposing these aspects
	of PSI separately. Now in the light of a better understanding provided
	by our past works we present and expand in a more coherent and holistic
	way the general theory of PSI algorithms. We are also providing herein
	new material not reported before. These new results are on; a well
	defined way to combine PSI algorithms and recursive linear PSI algorithms
	to obtain resonant quadrature filters.},
