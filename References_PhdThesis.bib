	These include robust filters that are relatively insensitive to edge

  abstract = {A principled approach, based on Bayesian estimation theory and complex-valued

	a new class of adaptive quadrature filters. These filters are capable
	of adapting their tuning frequency to the local dominant spatial
	frequency of the input image while maintaining an arbitrarily narrow
	local frequency response; therefore they may be effectively used
	for the accurate recovery of the phase of broadband spatial-carrier
	fringe patterns, even when they are corrupted by a significant amount
	of noise. Also, by constraining the spatial variation of the adaptive
	frequency to be smooth, they permit the completely automatic recovery
	of local phase from single closed fringe pattern images, since the
	spurious discontinuities and sign reversals that one obtains from
	the classical Fourier-based methods are avoided in this case. Although
	the applications discussed here come from fringe pattern analysis
	in optics, these filters may also be useful in the solution of other
